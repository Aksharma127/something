# Procedural Realistic Sunset

This Python script programmatically generates a highly realistic and detailed sunset landscape image. It uses Perlin noise for natural-looking terrain and clouds, and Matplotlib for rendering and saving the final image.

![Example Output](realistic_sunset.png)
*(Note: You will need to generate this image by running the script)*

## Features

-   **Realistic Sky Gradient:** A smooth, multi-point gradient transitions from a deep twilight blue to a fiery orange glow at the horizon.
-   **Gaussian Sun & Glow:** A soft sun core with a wide, realistic glow is calculated using a Gaussian distribution.
-   **Fractal Clouds:** Perlin noise is used to generate a layer of wispy, semi-transparent clouds that realistically obscure the sky.
-   **Layered Mountains:** Multiple mountain ranges are generated with varying color, haze, and detail to simulate atmospheric perspective and create a sense of depth.
-   **Tonal Polishing:** The final image is clipped to ensure all color values are within a valid range for a clean, polished look.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aksharma127/something.git
    cd something
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The script requires `numpy`, `noise`, and `matplotlib`. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**
    To generate the landscape, simply run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python realistic_sunset.py
    ```
    The script will display the image in a Matplotlib window and save a high-resolution version as `realistic_sunset.png` in the project directory.
