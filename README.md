# Procedural Landscape Generator

This project contains a Python script that programmatically generates a beautiful landscape image featuring a sunset over mountain ranges.

***Note: This project, including this README, was generated by Jules, an AI software engineer.***

## How it Works

The image is generated by layering several procedural components:

1.  **Sky Gradient:** A multi-color vertical gradient forms the background, transitioning from a deep blue/purple at the top to a fiery orange at the horizon, simulating a sunset.
2.  **Mountain Ranges:** Several layers of mountains are generated using Perlin noise. This algorithm creates natural-looking, irregular silhouettes. Atmospheric perspective is simulated by making distant mountains lighter and less detailed, while closer ranges are darker.

The final output is saved as a `procedural_sunset.png` file.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python 3:** The core programming language.
*   **NumPy:** Used for efficient numerical operations and to manage the image data as a 3D array.
*   **Pillow (PIL Fork):** Used to create and save the final PNG image file from the NumPy array.
*   **noise:** This library provides an implementation of Perlin noise, which is essential for generating the procedural terrain.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

Before running the script, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy Pillow noise
```

### 2. Run the Script

To generate the image, simply run the `generate_image.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python3 generate_image.py
```

Upon successful execution, the script will print a confirmation message and you will find a new file named `procedural_sunset.png` in the project directory.
